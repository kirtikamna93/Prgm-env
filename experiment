Experiment 1- Removed return(0); line
outcome: the program worked fine and produced the output. Google search for return(0) said "the main function is of type int and 
therefore should return an integer value.The return value of the main function is considered the "Exit Status" of the application. On
most operating systems returning 0 is a success status like saying " The program worked fine"
