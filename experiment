Experiment 1- Removed return(0); line
outcome: the program worked fine and produced the output. Google search for return(0) said "the main function is of type int and 
therefore should return an integer value.The return value of the main function is considered the "Exit Status" of the application. On
most operating systems returning 0 is a success status like saying " The program worked fine".
Question: Why did the program run whithout any return value?

Experiment 2- Removed #
outcome: when we did precompilation with # the number of lines (using the command gcc file.c|wc -l) was 852. After removing the # the 
number of lines was 12. By google search we got to know that The preprocessor actually copies the entire header into your source file.
Thus we got to know about the importance of # by this experiment.
